<p> 
My first language was Java, a <i>very</i> verbose language.
And even as comfortable as I am writing Java and can appreciate the good sides of its verbose-ness,
I often find myself wanting to be able to hit the ground running in a matter of minutes.
From conception to prototype--- like <i>that</i>. So naturally among the sea 
of canidetes I decided to go with Python.
